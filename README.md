```
GIVEN that I want an Escape from these troubling times

I WANT to see stuff that reminds me 90s Pop Culture
SO THAT I can remember how far Technology and UI has come over the last 30 years.
```

## Functionality

```
WHEN I create my rememberDat account
THEN I am given a list of categories to choose from
